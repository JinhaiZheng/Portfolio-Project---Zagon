        You have cleared all stages, it is time to tell you the meaning of "Zagon". <br>
        Zagon is transliterated from my hometown dialect, it means assorted soup, <br>
        a delicacy from my hometown city in China. The dish is basically mixiing every <br>
        kinds of vegetable to become a soup, therefore I get inspiration from it, <br>
        to name my little H5 game which has combined mutiple mini-games. <br>
